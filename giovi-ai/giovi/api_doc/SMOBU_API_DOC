Introduction
Our REST based APIs allow you to get access to the Smoobu Application. We have different APIs for different usecases. On this page we explain you a little bit more detailled what you need for your usecase as a host.

Please contact us before you start coding. We send you the necessary keys and all further information you need to know. Tell us a few words about your ideas and plans. We are always happy to help our customers and our partners to build a perfect integrated and easy to use solution.

Send us an email to api@smoobu.com to join our mailing list and keep updated about all issues, developer news and API updates.

Authentication
To authorize, use this code:

# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Api-Key: secretApiKey"
Make sure to replace secretApiKey with your API key.

If you want to develop an API for a single Smoobu user you will find all necessary IDs and Keys in settings for developers.
Please add API-key in the header in each request. If your API-Key is ABCDEFGH Your header should look like: ‘API-key: ABCDEFGH’

 You must replace secretApiKey with your personal API key.
If you are a developer of a third party tool which is relevant for more than one Smoobu user please read the part at the end of the documentation.

OAuth 2 Authentication
Currently OAuth 2 only supported for Smoobu partners.

Send a registration request to Smoobu for your application. You will get a Client Id and Client Secret. A redirect URL will be required which will be called after a host authorize your application. The URL is invoked with a query string containing a special authorization code that you can use to retrieve access tokens required for all Smoobu API calls.

Authorization
The authorization URL will be :

https://login.smoobu.com/{locale}/oauth/authorize?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&response_type=code&state={state}

URL Parameters

Parameter	Description
locale	Locale of Smoobu supported languages (i.e en, de, fr, it, es)
client_id	Provided from Smoobu
redirect_uri	Redirect Url provided at registration.
state	Random number/string
i.e

https://login.smoobu.com/de/oauth/authorize?client_id=10&redirect_uri=https://yourdomain.com/&response_type=code&state=20464541

After a host grants or denies your application access, your server must handle the authorization response. This response contains a code field which you can use to get an initial access token. The authorization code expired in 2 minutes after is is issued.

Example of success redirect.

https://yourdomain.com/?code=eef1b91d549f7c8fd4ccbfb6d96c32122e53b25e&state=20464541

In case of error, it will be like this.

https://yourdomain.com/?error=access_denied&error_description=The user denied access to your application&state=20464541 (The URL will be encoded)

Obtaining Access Token
Once you have authorization code, you can get the access token which can be used for other API calls.

To obtain access token, use this code:

curl --location --request POST 'https://login.smoobu.com/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'code=db9dba495938124bdd0e8635212280bf3cc76721' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://yourdomain.com/' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=10' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=1dde36bc0f25c842079e90871d55f019c331e29055'
The above command returns JSON structured like this (HTTP status code 200):

{ 
   "access_token":"c8c02e8af18fa10ff4388ebf9bcaa15a522b6cfe",
   "expires_in":3600,
   "token_type":"Bearer",
   "scope":null,
   "refresh_token":"610b630034a85d1805faca0d495f89ffc44e9a92"
}
Response if it failed (HTTP status code 400):

{ 
   "error":"invalid_grant",
   "error_description":"Authorization code doesn\u0027t exist or is invalid for the client"
}
POST Parameters

Parameter	Description
grant_type	authorization_code
code	Authorization code
redirect_uri	Redirect Url provided at registration.
client_id	Provided from Smoobu
client_secret	Provided from Smoobu
Refresh Token
If a access token expires, you can send a refresh token request in order to get new access token.

To get new access token, use this command:

curl --location --request POST 'https://login.smoobu.com/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token=2c3bb89326e5bc3a7e953b9eff72b2463b11b393' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=10' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=1dde36bc0f25c842079e90871d55f019c331e29055'
The above command returns JSON structured like this (HTTP status code 200):

{ 
   "access_token":"6490e32fad291d54402c5879dee4cd8840936b4c",
   "expires_in":3600,
   "token_type":"Bearer",
   "scope":null
}
Response if it failed (HTTP status code 400):

{ 
   "error":"invalid_grant",
   "error_description":"Invalid refresh token"
}
POST Parameters

Parameter	Description
grant_type	refresh_token
refresh_token	Refresh token.
client_id	Provided from Smoobu
client_secret	Provided from Smoobu
Using Access Token
Use of access token:

curl --location --request GET 'https://login.smoobu.com/api/apartments' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer  6490e32fad291d54402c5879dee4cd8840936b4c'
Instead of Api-Key, an authorization header is required.

Rate Limit
Smoobu allows up to 1000 request per minute. If this limit exceeded, you will receive HTTP response with status code 429.

Following rate limit headers are available in each response.

Header	Format	Description
X-RateLimit-Limit	int	Number of requests allowed in 1 minute window
X-RateLimit-Remaining	int	Remaining requests in 1 minute window
X-RateLimit-Retry-After	int	Current window expire time in Unix timestamp. Requests can be made after this time if rate limit exceeded.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policy
Due to security concerns, Smoobu API cannot be directly called from your website/front-end application. Instead, you can setup a proxy service (using any backend languages i.e PHP, Python, Node.js) which will securely call the Smoobu API and then pass the information back to your website.

Get User
Below command will return profile data of the current user based on Api-Key:

curl -X GET \
  https://login.smoobu.com/api/me \
  -H 'Api-Key: secretApiKey' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'
The above command returns JSON structured like this with Status code 200:

{
    "id": 7,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "jhon@example.com"

It is very important that calendars and rates are always up to date. If you use cron jobs you can never guarantee correct data in real time. So we provide a webhook functionality that notificates you if there are any updates. Every Smoobu user can enter a webhook URL in the API settings. Then we send a webhook containing a json file to this URL if there are any changes in the calendar regarding rates or availabilities.

For third party providers we send webhooks for all connected users that allow you to receive rates and availabilities.

Json
Parameter	Format	Description
action	string	action of the webhook (updateRates, newReservation, cancelReservation, updateReservation)
user	integer	user id
data	object	contain the data of the webhook. For the detailed information for single webhook look in the documentation of regarding request
