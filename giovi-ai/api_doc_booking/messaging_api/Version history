free_text: A message composed of plain text.

You can find information on the request status in the content field, which denotes the request as expired, accepted by the property, confirmed by the guest or rejected, etc. To learn more about Request to Book, see Manage holiday rentals with Booking.com’s Request to Book feature.

{
    "content": "Dear Booker! Welcome to Relax Hotel and enjoy your stay!",
    "message_id": "445082c0-3480-11ef-944b-3fb458583f03",

    "attributes": {
        "template_id": "10914788",
        "template_name": "Welcome Template"
    }
}
Adding guest name in metadata.name
We've added the guest's name to the metadata.name field of the guest participant entity. You'll find this within the message or conversation objects.

Guest name is optional
The guest name might not be set in some cases. So this field is optional. In addition, guest names are not provided in Request-to-Book (RtB) conversations until a reservation is confirmed. Once the booking is confirmed, the guest's name will appear for that conversation, applying to all messages within it, including both historical and new communications.

Supporting Self-Service request messages
We've added messages for self-service requests (special and structured requests) to the response to all endpoints with a GET method in v1.2, except the GET /messages/latest endpoint. These messages follow the same format as standard messages. Their message_type field is set to self_service_event. For more information, see Understanding self-service requests.

Retrieving Self-Service Messages via the `GET /messages/latest` endpoint
To receive self-service messages through the GET /messages/latest endpoint, you must activate the Enable special and structured requests (enable_self_services_messaging) feature in the Provider Portal. Note that this endpoint doesn't support retrieving these messages via a version header. After enabling this feature, self-service messages will automatically be included in responses for the following endpoints, irrespective of the API version in use:
- GET /messages/latest
- GET /messages/search/result/{job_id}
- GET /properties/{property_id}/conversations
- GET /properties/{property_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}
- GET /properties/{property_id}/conversations/type/{conversation_type}
If you need help with this setting, reach out to Connectivity Support.

For detailed information regarding self-service request updates to the relevant endpoints, check the following documentation:

GET /messages/latest
GET /messages/search
GET /messages/search/result/{job_id}
