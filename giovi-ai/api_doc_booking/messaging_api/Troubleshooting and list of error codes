Working with errors
This section captures a list of common HTTP errors you might encounter and possible solutions to fix them.

HTTP Error Code	Error Text	Reason	Possible Fix
HTTP 401	Access denied	The credentials provided in the request was not sufficient for a successful authentication check.	To fix a failed authentication request, see the Authentication page.
HTTP 403	This account doesn't have access to this property	Possible reasons are, you are trying to send updates:
- for a property with the wrong hotel ID.
- using machine acco
unt that do not have access to the specified hotel ID.
- for a property which is no longer connected to your interface.	Make sure to specify the correct hotel ID or check your machine account credentials. You can then follow the steps:
1. Check if the property is connected to you in the Provider Portal.
2. Check if the connection status is active in the ‘Properties’ tab in the Provider Portal, using the property ID.
3. Check if the property is added to the machine account you use under ‘Machine Accounts’ in the Provider Portal.
