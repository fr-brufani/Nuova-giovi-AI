Acknowledging new reservations
Booking.com maintains all incoming reservations specific to a provider using a dedicated queue. For OTA implementation, Booking.com waits until you acknowledge receiving the reservations successfully before removing the acknowledged reservations from the queue. Otherwise, Booking.com forwards the missed reservations as an email to the property after a specific time period.

By acknowledging reservations, you confirm:

Retrieving the most updated reservation details.
Processing the retrieved reservation.
To acknowledge new reservations


POST 
https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/ota/OTA_HotelResNotif
Use the POST OTA_HotelResNotif endpoint to acknowledge a new reservation. When acknowledging you can send one of the following status:

Successfully processed - Booking.com acknowledges and removes the reservation from the queue.
Unsuccessfully processed - Booking.com keeps the reservations in the queue until you acknowledge successfully or until the timeout period.
Use the POST OTA_HotelResNotif endpoint to acknowledge processing the reservations.

Confirm each reservation
Make sure to confirm every reservation message in separate requests or in one request using the HotelReservationID tag multiple times.
