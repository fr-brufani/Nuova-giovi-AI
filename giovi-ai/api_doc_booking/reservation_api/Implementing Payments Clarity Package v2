This topic details the scope of change when implementing the Payments Clarity Package v2 and outlines steps to test, and identify the change in the response.

Understanding the scope of change
If you had implemented the existing Payments Clarity Package feature, following are the possible changes when implementing the new Payments Clarity Package v2:

Change 1: Withheld tax details shown under price details
You can find an additional entry for every tax component that Booking.com has to withhold.

Change 2: Improved payment details: Price details showing collection (GuestView) and disbursement breakdown (HotelView)
You can find two new sections in the response schema: GuestView and HotelView listing the booking amount breakup. If you previously used the features: Payments Clarity Package (vcc_payment_v2) or the Include Price Details (include_price_details), the price breakdown data will now be replaced with the new sections in the response schema: GuestView and HotelView.

Change 3: Redefined Inclusive/Exclusive values
The definitions for the Inclusive/Exclusive values have now changed.

Change 4: New logic when calculating the total amount for guest view and hotel view
The total amount is calculated based on the new definition.

Based on the changes discussed above, make sure to:

Update all properties with the new definition of the Inclusive/Exclusive values for the taxes / fees in the price breakdown.
Revisit the price calculation:
If you validate whether fees, taxes or charges are included in the price when recalculating the reservation price using the Include Price Details (include_price_details) or the Payments Clarity Package (vcc_payment_v2) features, you must update your calculations.
To avoid showing incorrect reservation prices, revisit the price calculation as the relevant flags and amounts will change when the new Payments Clarity Package v2 (payment_clarity_package_v2) feature is enabled.
OTA response changes
What do the changes mean for properties?
After implementing Payments Clarity Package v2 (payment_clarity_package_v2), properties can determine:

Whether they need to collect certain taxes / fees from guests.
Whether they need to remit the taxes / fees to the authorities directly. You can find more information in the Summary of different combinations of included value.
Before you start
Make sure you follow these high-level steps to set up a test environment:

Request a test property with withheld tax configured.

i) Contact the [Connectivity Support team][contact-us] to request a test property. The test property will have withheld tax and Payments by Booking virtual credit cards (VCCs) solution enabled.
ii) Set availability for the test property with withheld tax and create test reservations:
Follow the tutorial Create a test reservation to set availability and make test reservations.
iii) Set low room inventory prices and a flexible cancellation policy which allows for free cancellation.
iv) While creating test bookings, use a valid payment method, such as using a PayPal account. You will receive a refund upon cancellation.

Prepare a test property without withheld tax configured, to see the changes that Payments Clarity Package v2 will bring for properties without withheld tax, such as changes in the confirmation of non-Payments by Booking reservations (agency bookings).

i) Prepare a test property that is not on Payments by Booking.
ii) Follow the tutorial Create a test reservation and use our test credit card (card number 4111 1111 1111 1111) for the payment method.

(Optional) Prepare a test property without withheld tax configured and where the property is on Payments by Booking (Bank Transfer). This shows the changes that Payments Clarity Package v2 will bring for properties without withheld tax.*

i) Prepare a test property that is on Payments by Booking (Bank Transfer).
ii) Follow the tutorial Create a test reservation and use a valid payment method, such as using a PayPal account. You will receive a refund upon cancellation.

How to test
Make an API request to retrieve an existing reservation using the reservation ID (id) query parameter and specify the feature in the header to see and compare the changes.

Make a request for a reservation using your current implementation.
Make the same request but add the Features: payment_clarity_package_v2 header.
Compare the responses to understand how your price calculations will need to change.
For example, you can send a cURL request by adding the header as follows:



curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Basic xxxxx" -H "Features: payment_clarity_package_v2" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/ota/OTA_HotelResNotif
Testing tax withholding component
For providers who manage properties located in a region where Booking.com is obligated to withhold and remit taxes on behalf of the property: Before testing this feature you need to fulfill certain additional requirements. For more information, contact the Connectivity Support team.

Understanding tax remittance using Payments Clarity Package v2
Based on the property’s location and tax configuration, multiple taxes could apply for each reservation or booking. If the property participates in Payments by Booking.com, and is paid via virtual credit card (VCC), then Booking.com is obligated to collect and pay certain taxes on behalf of the property whereas the property is directly obligated to remit certain other taxes.

The ability to support showing reservations that detail the division of tax responsibilities between Booking.com and the property is known as split tax obligation and remittance.

You can find more details of the various scenarios in the Summary of different combinations of Inclusive/Exclusive value.

The following outlines the three types of tax remittances and reservation message examples of each type.

Booking remits all taxes
Partner remits all taxes
Split tax obligation between Booking.com and partner
Booking.com remits all taxes and fees
Booking.com remits taxes when the property has all taxes and fees defined the same way as scenario 3 in Summary of different combinations of Inclusive/Exclusive value and uses Payments by Booking.com virtual credit card (VCC) payouts.

Scenario	Guest View	Property View	Payments by Booking behaviour
3	Inclusive	Exclusive	- Fees/tax was collected from the guest during booking.
- Fees/tax is withheld and will be paid directly to the authorities and not to property.
Consider the following scenario - Property ABC has the following tax configurations:

Booking.com remits:

5% Local Community Impact Fee
1.5% Recreation and Public Improvement Promotion Tax
2% Parks Recreation and Community Economic Development Tax
The following reservation message snippet shows that all the three taxes are remitted by Booking.com. The actual tax names and tax amounts of your properties will differ, depending on the specifics, such as the property’s location and tax configuration.

Expand this section to view the OTA response example when Booking.com remits all taxes and fees.
Partner remits all taxes and fees
The partner remits taxes when the property has all taxes and fees defined the same way as scenario 4 in Summary of different combinations of Inclusive/Exclusive value and uses Payments by Booking.com virtual credit card (VCC) payouts.

Scenario	Guest View	Property View	Payments by Booking behaviour
4	Inclusive	Exclusive	- Fees/tax was collected from the guest during booking.
- Fees/tax will be paid out to property.
Consider the following scenario - Property ABC has the following tax configurations:

Partner needs to remit:

2% Occupancy tax

The following reservation message snippet shows that the partner needs to remit both the taxes. The actual tax names and tax amounts of your properties will differ, depending on the specifics, such as the property’s location and tax configuration.

Expand this section to view the OTA response example when the partner remits all taxes and fees.
Split tax obligations and remittance
Split tax obligations and remittance occur when the property has taxes and fees defined the same way as scenarios 3 and 4 in Summary of different combinations of Inclusive/Exclusive value, respectively, and uses Payments by Booking.com virtual credit card (VCC) payouts.

Scenario	Guest View	Property View	Payments by Booking behaviour
3	Inclusive	Exclusive	- Fees/tax was collected from the guest during booking.
- Fees/tax is withheld and will be paid directly to the authorities and not to property.
