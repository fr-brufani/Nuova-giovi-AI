Retrieving new reservations
Use the OTA_HotelResNotif endpoint to retrieve and acknowledge new reservations. To process modified or cancelled reservations using OTA specifications, use the OTA_HotelResModifyNotif endpoint.

At a high level, processing new reservations includes:

Retrieving new reservations, and,
Acknowledging that you have processed the reservations.
To retrieve new reservations
Use the GET OTA_HotelResNotif endpoint to get all the recent property reservations made through the Booking.com channels. By default, the response contains only reservations which have not yet been acknowledged.

To ensure timely delivery of data, call GET OTA_HotelResNotif once per twenty seconds. However, to help ensure that acknowledgements have been processed, wait five seconds between POST OTA_HotelResNotif and the next GET OTA_HotelResNotif.

Optionally, you can apply filters to retrieve:

A single reservation.
Reservations specific to certain properties specified by property IDs.
Reservations which were booked or changed since a specified date.
A maximum number of reservations to return per call.

Query parameters
The following table describes the optional elements you can add as query parameters to filter the incoming reservations.

Use filters sparingly
To process reservations optimally, Booking.com recommends that you use these parameters sparingly and only while retrieving reservations immediately after an unexpected outage. Make sure to remove these parameters after recovering from unexpected events.

Element	Description	Type	Required/Optional	Notes
id	Specify a reservation ID to retrieve a single reservation.	integer	optional	Specify a reservation ID that you have already retrieved. For accurate results, use the hotel_ids parameter and specify the property ID. With this parameter, you may access reservations made more than two weeks in the past.
Use the OTA_HotelResModifyNotif endpoint for reservations that have been modified or cancelled and OTA_HotelResNotif for all other reservations.
For example, https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/ota/OTA_HotelResNotif?id=2672953870&hotel_ids=8011855
hotel_ids	Specify the unique property ID(s), separated by comma, to limit results to those properties. You can specify, for example, 10 property IDs.	integer	optional	Use only comma separated property IDs to specify individual property ID values. When retrieving reservations for multiple properties using this parameter, if you do not have access to some properties, the API returns a Warning in the response only for those properties while returning reservations for all other properties that you have access to. Use this parameter to restrict the results to a given property.
For example, when servicing an interactive request, you may pass hotel_ids for the partner account and id from an input field. If they do not match, the API returns 404 status. For example, https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/ota/OTA_HotelResNotif?id=2672953870&hotel_ids=8011855
last_change	[Only applicable when Reservations Recovery API is not implemented] Specify a date, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, to retrieve all reservations that were created, modified or cancelled since the specified date. You can request reservations up until 2 weeks in the past.	datetime	optional	Using this filter, the API returns reservations starting from the oldest reservation. You can limit the returned reservations count by specifying the limit parameter.
Use this parameter only when recovering lost reservations after an unexpected outage. Specifying a future date and time returns 0 reservations.
Using this filter immediately after a daylight-savings time change may return 0 or more reservations depending on whether the clock was set ahead or behind.
Important: Using this filter when the feature: Enable Reservation Recovery API (enable_reservation_recovery_api) is turned on, returns a HTTP 400 error.
limit	Specify a maximum number of reservations to return. Specify a value >=10 and <= 200.	integer	optional	The API may return reservations less than the specified limit based on the immediate availability of data, even if there are enough reservations to satisfy the limit. This filter can improve latency at the expense of throughput, therefore it adds a risk of a throughput bottleneck. It is not recommended to use a low value when retrieving new bookings and modifications.
Query parameter example
The following query retrieves reservation(s) that meet the following conditions:

Reservations that belong to the property: 8011855 and if providers have access to them.
Reservations that were created/modified since 2025-03-31 11:00:00.
Only 200 reservations.



GET https://secure-supply-xml.booking.com/hotels/ota/OTA_HotelResNotif?hotel_ids=8011855&last_change=2025-03-31+11%3A00%3A00&limit=200

You can identify this information where the TaxDescription > Text contains: {{Tax_Name}} (Withheld tax)`
Currency code: Specifies the currency code of the virtual credit card.
Testing Payments Clarity Package v2 before implementing
Test this feature before implementation due to changes in pricing structure and based on the following two critical changes:

The computed amount in the total field is calculated differently.
The Inclusive/Exclusive values for the Type field uses a different logic. For a detailed comparison, see comparing the existing Payments Clarity Package with the new Payments Clarity Package v2.
For example, if you have been validating whether fees, taxes or charges are included in the price when recalculating the reservation prices, then you must revisit the price calculation. Doing this can avoid showing incorrect reservation prices.

For more information on how to test by passing the Features: payment_clarity_package_v2 header parameter in your request header, see Implementing Payments Clarity Package v2.

Overrides include_price_details and vcc_payment_v2 features
If you switch to the Payments Clarity Package v2(payment_clarity_package_v2) feature, your price and payment data will now come exclusively from this feature, replacing the older include_price_details and vcc_payment_v2 features.

In case you have the Provider XML setting: Dummy credit card on Last Minute No CC Reservations turned on, then the API returns dummy credit card details on last minute or same day, or domestic bookers.

Implement the latest version: Payments Clarity Package v2(payment_clarity_package_v2) to get a detailed breakdown of each booking’s total price, including tax details. It also breaks down the amount based on the guest and the property's perspectives. To compare the difference in data between the two features, see Payment clarity package features comparison.

If you have been using this feature, we recommend you to test and migrate to the Payments Clarity Package v2(payment_clarity_package_v2) feature. For more help with the migration, contact Connectivity Support.

When the feature: Payments Clarity Package (vcc_payment_v2) is enabled, you can view the following information in the response:

Price details: Contains information on specified taxes and charges.
Current balance: Specifies the current balance on the VCC.
Card expiration date: Specifies the date the VCC expires in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is Booking.com standard. ExpiryDate follows the physical credit card standard. Both refer to the same expiration date, but one is more specific.
Card activation date: Specifies the date the VCC was activated in YYYY-MM-DD format.
If the Provider XML setting: Dummy credit card on Last Minute No CC Reservations is turned on, then the API returns dummy credit card details on last minute or same day, or domestic bookers. You can notice that the card details are not real by looking for the following:

The VCC details are the same.
The credit card holder's name is NOCCRESERVATION.
The ExpireDate is one year from the date of reservation.
